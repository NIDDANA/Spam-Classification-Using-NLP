# Spam-Classification-Using-NLP

Project Overview
This project involves building a spam classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to classify emails or text messages as spam or not spam. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a web application.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Removal of punctuation, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.
Feature Extraction: Using CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Training multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
Model Deployment: Deploying the best model using Streamlit for real-time spam detection
